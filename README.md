Description

## Installation

1.  **Download the Plugin:** 
    - The latest version of the plugin is a `.jar` file located in the  [`target/`](https://github.com/labmus-ufrj/tracking-plugin/tree/main/target)directory of this project.

2.  **Locate Your Fiji Installation:**
    - Find where you have Fiji installed on your computer. This is often in your `Documents` or `Program Files` folder.

3.  **Copy the `.jar` File:**
    - Copy the `.jar` file you downloaded into the `jars` folder inside your Fiji installation directory (`Fiji.app/plugins/`).

    - The final file path should look something like this:
      - `C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\Fiji.app\jars\ZebraFish_Utils-0.0.1.jar`
      - or `C:\Program Files\Fiji.app\jars\ZebraFish_Utils-0.0.1.jar`

4.  **Restart Fiji:** Close and reopen Fiji to continue the installation.

5. **Install the dependencies** (this is only done once, not every update)
   - Open Fiji with administrator privileges until this process is done
   - Open ZF Utils > FFmpeg
   - Follow the instructions, you will need to restart Fiji multiple times

## Updating the Plugin

Each time you install a new version of this plugin, you **must** replace the old `.jar` file with the new one. Simply follow the installation steps above and overwrite the existing file when prompted. This ensures you are always using the latest version.
