-> FFmpeg plugin repeats the first frame of videos converted to AVI (probably to all of them), doing it from blank->end

-> Use... or suggest the usage of... that excel export plugin

-> Write documentation
    -> inform about converting to grayscale everywhere? where it belongs
    -> image calc: images and videos might be in different resolutions, bit depths, channel count, etc. lets document that.

-> Quantify Heatmap
-> Extract Frequency Data
-> Calculate Score Sectors
-> Extract Tracking Data

-> provide more test samples, ready to be tested ones, to be linked in each tool/feature

-> framerate reduction for tracking processing?
-> add more stuff to about plugin section

-> change apply brightness function to use openCV one

-> heatmap video não obedece startframe?
