-> proximo programa em python: image calculator!

-> maybe encapsulate all errors in FFmpeg like in Z project

-> some error occurs when processing the whole video with zproject (1998 out of 2001 frames or something)

-> image calc is not waiting for completion before saying its done

-> test image calc more overall
