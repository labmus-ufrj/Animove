-> FFmpeg plugin repeats the first frame of videos converted to AVI (probably to all of them), doing it from blank->end

-> Use... or suggest the usage of... that excel export plugin

-> Write documentation

-> Generate Heatmap Images
-> Quantify Heatmap
-> Extract Frequency Data
-> Calculate Score Sectors
-> Extract Tracking Data

-> Save current stack as video (avi or mp4. needs to be easy.)
-> test if saving video from opened stack is feasible (too slow?), or what needs to be done in this matter
    -> maybe I auto adjust the brightness somehow -> convertTo() alfa and beta...

-> heatmaps need TREATMENT before sum or nothing will work!!
-> provide more test samples, ready to be tested ones, to be linked in each tool/feature

-> test image calculator
    - images and videos might be in different resolutions, bit depths, channel count, etc. Fix it or warn users. -> lets document that.
-> document image calculator

-> FrameGrabber has some trouble finding total number of frames on large files. off-by-one error. avi and mp4 affected.
    -> up to 10 frames everything is working... something is happening
