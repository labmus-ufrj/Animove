-> convert ROICreator and ZFhelper methods to use @parameter Dataset instead of the ImageDisplay

-> some error occurs when processing the whole video with zproject (1998 out of 2001 frames or something)
    - -> image calc is not waiting for completion before saying its done (probably the same thing some issue with OpenCV)

-> proximo programa em python: image calculator!

-> test image calc more overall

-> image calculator should support 32bit sum

-> FFmpeg plugin wont work on AVI's generated by imageJ (compression: none)
