-> FFmpeg plugin repeats the first frame of videos converted to AVI (probably to all of them), doing it from blank->end

-> Use... or suggest the usage of... that excel export plugin

-> Write documentation
    -> inform about converting to grayscale everywhere? where it belongs
    -> image calc: images and videos might be in different resolutions, bit depths, channel count, etc. lets document that.

-> Generate Heatmap Images
-> Quantify Heatmap
-> Extract Frequency Data
-> Calculate Score Sectors
-> Extract Tracking Data

-> Save current stack as video (avi or mp4. needs to be easy.)
-> test if saving video from opened stack is feasible (too slow?), or what needs to be done in this matter
    -> maybe I auto adjust the brightness somehow -> convertTo() alfa and beta...

-> provide more test samples, ready to be tested ones, to be linked in each tool/feature

-> HeatmapImages needs to use HeatmapFunction somehow. I may need a static function like RetainLastFrame that creates a copy of all frames given to it.
