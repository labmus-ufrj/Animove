-> Extract Frequency Data
-> Extract Tracking Data
-> Thigmotaxis

-> Save ROI to ROI Manager
    -> heatmap sum image
    -> heatmap sum video
    -> adults tracking

-> gradient scroe analysis
    -> write median value below track 1 in box plot and in title in dial
    -> make montage of track score dials

-> quantify heatmap binary should be a separate thing, to be used with tanks recorded sideways

-> provide more test samples, ready to be tested ones, to be linked in each tool/feature
