-> some error occurs when processing the whole video with zproject (1998 out of 2001 frames or something)
    - -> image calc is not waiting for completion before saying its done (probably the same thing some issue with OpenCV)

-> FFmpeg has weird methods public and protected should all be private - done

-> Paloma said codecs arent working properly on windows player - done. pixel format was causin it. fixed: just change that when needed

-> proximo programa em python: image calculator!

-> test image calc more overall

-> image calculator should support 32bit sum
