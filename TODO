-> FFmpeg plugin repeats the first frame of videos converted to AVI (probably to all of them), doing it from blank->end

-> Use... or suggest the usage of... that excel export plugin

-> Write documentation

-> Generate Heatmap Images
-> Quantify Heatmap
-> Extract Frequency Data
-> Calculate Score Sectors
-> Extract Tracking Data
-> Save current stack as video (avi or mp4. needs to be easy.)
-> allow tools to work with tiff stacks?

-> heatmap video save using FFmpegFrameRecorder - done, but now only 8bit works. might need to revert later - or save as tiff, makes more sense for pre-processing
    - thats it. tiff for everything not done yet, as its lossless
    - avi only where imageJ requires to open something, and dont have that much importance on the loss side of thing (tracking. thats it.)
-> heatmaps need TREATMENT before sum or nothing will work!!
-> provide more test samples, ready to be tested ones, to be linked in each tool/feature

-> test image calculator
    - images and videos might be in different resolutions, bit depths, channel count, etc. Fix it or warn users.
    - add sum option?
-> document image calculator

-> implement simple recorder's quality setting? (and change AVI pixel format?)
