!!! Note "Results Table Output"
    Exporting data from imageJ's result tables to the default CSV option can led to problems related to decimal case separators.
    If you found this error, we recommend the usage of [Excel Functions](https://imagej.net/plugins/excel-functions), a plugin that allows trouble-free data exports to xlsx format.
