# ZebraFish Utils

## Goals

This plugin aims to make it possible to process large amounts of video data with low-spec hardware, specifically to quantify and analyze zebrafish kinetic activity. 

## Features

Using Fiji as its backbone, it inherits its multi-platform capabilities. Bytedeco's JavaCPP Presets for FFmpeg and OpenCV makes the low-RAM processing possible, here implemented with the necessary graphical interfaces and integrations with ImageJ's codebase.
