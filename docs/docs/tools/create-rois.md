# Create Sequential ROIs

Creates circular ROIs according to the number and size specified by the user.
Positions them according to a grid (the smallest divisors to the chosen well amount).
The size unit will rely on the scale previously stated.
All ROIs are added to the ROI manager.

Changing their position consists of:

1. Clicking at one ROI in the ROI Manager.
2. Moving the selected ROI around.
3. Clicking Update in ROI Manager.

Saving these ROIs is recommended, as they are used in many functions and are re-usable.

!!! warning "Saving ROIs"
    Avoid saving only one ROI instead of the whole collection. Before saving, select all of them in the ROI Manager (using the Shift key).
